# Mobile Module for BrowserCMS

## Features (Completed)

* Developers can define a .mobile.erb template for any existing .html.erb template on a project.
* Visitors on mobile device, who request a page with a mobile template will get that mobile template.
* Editors always see the desktop template

Caveats:
* Doesn't work with cached pages.


## Issues
* What happens if I don't create a mobile template for a page.
* If .mobile view exists, but no .mobile template, it renders with no layout. (Does not fall back to .html)

## Features (Possible)

1. Developers should be able to specify a .mobile.erb template for any existing CMS site template.
1. On m.domain.com
1. If UserAgent = Mobile, then use mobile template.
1. Allow user to set a preference for mobile vs full site.


Implementation Details

* If there is no .mobile view, it will use the .html layout even if there is a .mobile template. The view itself needs to be defined as .mobile.
* If templatename.mobile exists, it should use that. Otherwise, fall back to .html without complaining.

## m.subdomain
* Rails application would have to handle redirecting to m. based on user preference or User Agent
* Redirection within Rails will not work due to caching (Request would cache HTML and never make it to Rails)
* User preferences could be handled via a permanent cookie.
